UFO: ALIEN INVASION is a squad-based tactical strategy game in the
tradition of the old X-COM PC games, but with a twist. Our game
combines military realism with hard science-fiction and the weirdness
of an alien invasion. The carefully constructed turn-based system
gives you pin-point control of your squad while maintaining a sense
of pace and danger.
