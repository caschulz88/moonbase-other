Graphite2 is a rendering engine for graphite fonts. These are TrueType fonts with additional 
tables containing smart rendering information and were originally developed to support complex 
non-Roman writing systems. They may contain rules for e.g. ligatures, glyph substitution, 
kerning, justification - this can make them useful even on text written in Roman writing systems 
such as English. Note that firefox provides an internal copy of the graphite engine and cannot use 
a system version, but it too should benefit from the availability of graphite fonts.
