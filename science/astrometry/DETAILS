If you have astronomical imaging of the sky with celestial coordinates you do 
not know?or do not trust?then Astrometry.net is for you. Input an image and 
we'll give you back astrometric calibration meta-data, plus lists of known 
objects falling inside the field of view.

We have built this astrometric calibration service to create correct, 
standards-compliant astrometric meta-data for every useful astronomical image 
ever taken, past and future, in any state of archival disarray. We hope this 
will help organize, annotate and make searchable all the world's astronomical 
information.
