        SHORT="Microsoft Works file format import filter"

cat << EOF
libwps is a Microsoft Works file format import filter based on top of the libwpd
(which is already used in three word processors). Currently, libwps is a new 
project, but it imports all Works formats since about 1995 with some success.
